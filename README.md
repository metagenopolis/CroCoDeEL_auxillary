## Included Workflows

### [`meteor2_wf`](./meteor2_wf)

> **Purpose**: Execute [Meteor2](https://github.com/metagenopolis/Meteor) on short-read metagenomic data to generate gene and species abundance tables.

ðŸ“˜ [See full documentation](./meteor2_wf/README.md)

### [`simulate_conta_rarefaction_wf`](./simulate_conta_rarefaction_wf)

> **Purpose**: Simulate sample cross-contamination by rarefaction and mixing from real metagenomic datasets, as defined in a user-provided table.

ðŸ“˜ [See full documentation](./simulate_conta_read_subsampling_wf/README.md)


### [`simulate_conta_read_subsampling_wf`](./simulate_conta_read_subsampling_wf)

> **Purpose**: Simulate sample cross-contamination by subsampling and mixing reads from real metagenomic datasets, as defined in a user-provided table.
